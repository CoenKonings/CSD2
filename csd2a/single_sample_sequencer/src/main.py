main.py:
Ask user how many notes they want to enter, after which the user will be able
to enter note durations where 1 is a quarter note, 0.5 is an eighth, etc.
After the notes are entered, the user can enter the BPM at which the rhythm
should be played. Finally, the sample (wav) with which the sample should be
played can be entered. The program then plays the rhythm using the given
sample.
