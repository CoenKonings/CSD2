# Reflectie

## Takeaways
This was the first time I worked with audio in Python, and the event based structure was a nice addition.

Using multithreading to allow user input while running the program, and the use of queues to facilitate communication between threads was also new for me, and definitely seems like a useful skill to have learned.

Designing an intuitive method to interact with the system was also new to me, and I think I've managed to succeed relatively well.

## Future improvement
I started creating before I had a plan - I had already spent a week and a half on the final assignment before I realized that I had to restructure the program to accomodate for some of the requirements. Luckily, I had also spent quite some time on cleaning up my code, which was useful when adding previously unplanned functionalities. Next time, I will definitely decide on my plan before I start working.

## Hours
The list below shows an estimate of the amount of time spent on each feature, excluding the features that were built during the event based sequencer, ritmische player and single sample sequencer assignments.
- cleanup time: 6,
- markov chain: 5,
- regen command: 5,
- bugfixing: 4,
- metric modulation: 3,
- threading: 3,
- bpm change: 1,
- midi export: 1
